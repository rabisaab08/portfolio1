### Projects
**Cardboard chair
- First year of engineering temwork projects was to build an effective chair made out of cardboard wih specific requirements given.
- I prototyped multiple chairs with different design on the inside to minimize the amount of cardboard used while making sure that the chair could hold enough weight on it.
- I was responsible in my group to reaserch about the measurments that we would need for the chair as it should be designed for a child of certain age.
- I assisted my group as well with the folding methods we could use at the bottom of the chair.

**Claw
- Project that required us to build a claw out of aluminum metal sheets and arduino kit
- My teamate and I were in charge to figure out the code needed for our claw. This required the distance from the surface to our claww as well as the timing between it opens and closes.
- I was also in charge of prototyping the claw as our first protoype failed to open up and close.
- My team ended up using my prototype that did not require any hing for the claw to open as well as claw teeeth made out of elastics to create friction when picking up an object

** arduino security system
- During the summer of 2023, I spent my time designing a security system for my room with an arduino kit
- I wanted to refine my skill using arduino as well as creatign new designs
- Using an arduino board, a buzzer, led and a matrix keyboard, I was able to create a lock on my room door that requires a password to be let in.
- This was a fun project to monitor who can enter my room with my permission.
