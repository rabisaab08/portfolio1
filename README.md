- Provided orientation to new engineering students showing them around campus and meeting with professors
- Assisted the incoming students who were diverse and from different backgrounds and helped them adjust to the first day of university in the engineering program.
- Created a welcoming environment for incoming students by providing them with advice on how to adjust to college life.

**Summer camp leader @ ST.PAul's church (_Aug 2016-Aug 2023_)

- Responsible for teaching new concepts and helping kids from the ages 7-14 with their homework
- Help them improve their communication skills in these 2 different languages as well as their math knowledge
- Communicate with their parents about their progress and ensure that they are still motivated to learn new concepts

**Sea cadets @ Airdrie community service (_sep 2018-Sep2022_)

- Also doing sports competitions and learning new skills such as tying knots and sailing boats
- Learning discipline and respect in our Cadet groups as well as leadership and teamwork
  
### Projects
**Cardboard chair
- In the first year of engineering our teamwork project was to build an effective chair made out of cardboard with specific requirements given.
- I prototyped multiple chairs with different designs on the inside to minimize the amount of cardboard used while making sure that the chair could hold enough weight on it.
- I was responsible in my group researching the measurements that we would need for the chair as it should be designed for a child of a certain age.
- I assisted my group as well with the folding methods we could use at the bottom of the chair.

**Claw
- Project that required us to build a claw out of aluminum metal sheets and an Arduino kit
- My teammate and I were in charge of figuring out the code needed for our claw. This required the distance from the surface to our claw as well as the timing between its opening and closing.
- I was also in charge of prototyping the claw as our first prototype failed to open up and close.
- My team ended up using my prototype that did not require any hinge for the claw to open as well as claw teeth made out of elastics to create friction when picking up an object

** Arduino security system
- During the summer of 2023, I spent my time designing a security system for my room with an Arduino kit
- I wanted to refine my skills using Arduino as well as creating new designs
- Using an Arduino board, a buzzer, an LED and a matrix keyboard, I was able to create a lock on my room door that requires a password to be let in.
- This was a fun project to monitor who could enter my room with my permission.

** Guitar pick AutoCAD
- Creating a guitar pick holder with my team members in my first-year course to assist people that might have disabilities or might find it challenging to hold a guitar pick.
- Using AutoCAD, I had to take into consideration the measurement of an average guitar pick as well as the motion of playing a guitar
- I designed multiple prototypes to see which one would be more effective and easier to use for our stakeholders.
